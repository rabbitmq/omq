## omq

`omq` is a messaging system client for testing purposes. It currently supports AMQP-1.0, STOMP and MQTT 3.1.
It is developed mostly for RabbitMQ but might be useful for other brokers as well (some tests against ActiveMQ
were performed).

`omq` starts a group of publishers and a group of consumers, in both cases all publishers/consumers are identical,
except for the target terminus/queue/routing key, which may be slightly different. The publishers can use
a different protocol than the consumers.

`omq` has subcommands for all protocol combinations. For example:
```
./omq stomp-amqp
```
will publish via STOMP and consume via AMQP (see below for the topic/queue/routing key details). A more complex example:
```
./omq mqtt-amqp --publishers 10 --consumers 1 --publish-to 'sensor/%d' --consume-from '/topic/sensor.#' --rate 1 --size 100
```
will start 10 MQTT publishers, each publishing 1 message a second, with a 100 bytes of payload, to the `amq.topic` exchange (default for the MQTT plugin)
with the topic/routing key of `sensor/%d`, where the `%d` is the ID of the publisher (from 1 to 10). It will also start a single AMQP 1.0 consumer that
consumes all those messages thanks to a wildcard subscription.

If the publishing and consuming protocol is the same, you can use abbreviated commands: `amqp` instead of `amqp-amqp`, `stomp` instead of `stomp-stomp`
and `mqtt` instead of `mqtt-mqtt`.

### Installation

```
go install github.com/rabbitmq/omq@main
```

### Terminus/Topic/Queue/Routing Key

Different protocols refer to the targets / sources of messages differently and RabbitMQ handles each protocol differently as well.

`--publish-to` (or `-t`) refers to where to publish the messages - it is passed as-is to the publisher, except for MQTT (see below)
`--consume-from` (or `-T`) refers to where to consume the messages from - it is passed as-is to the consumer, except for MQTT (see below)

For convenience, if either `--publish-to` or `--consume-from` starts with `/exchange/amq.topic/` or `/topic/`, MQTT publisher/consumer
will remove that prefix. RabbitMQ only allows using a single topic exchange with MQTT (`amq.topic` by default), so this prefix doesn't make
much sense. Removing it makes it easier to use the same parameters across protocols - for example unit tests run all protocol combinations
with `--publish-to /topic/<protocol1><protocol2> --consume-from /topic/<protocol1><protocol2>`, which wouldn't work with MQTT without
this special handling ("/topic/" would be a part of the topic/binding key).


### Metrics

`omq` exposes Prometheus metrics on port 8080, or the next available port if 8080 is in use (so 8081, 8082, and so on). This makes it easy to run multiple
`omq` instances on a single machine - just configure 8080 and the next few ports as Prometheus targets and it'll scrape them whenever metrics are available.
Sample Prometheus scrape config:
```
  - job_name: omq
    scrape_interval: 1s
    scrape_timeout: 1s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - localhost:8080
        - localhost:8081
        - localhost:8082
```

You can find [a simple dashboard](./dashboard/OMQ-Grafana.json) in this repo.

Additionally, the final values of the metrics are printed when `omq` finishes. A nicer output or TUI will be available at some point.

### Compatibility with perf-test

[perf-test](https://perftest.rabbitmq.com/) is the main testing tool used with RabbitMQ. It has many more options, but only supports AMQP 0-9-1
(historically, the main protocol used with RabbitMQ). `omq` uses the same message format for end-to-end latency measurment and therefore
messages published with perf-test can be consumed by `omq` or vice versa, and the end-to-end latency will be measured.
